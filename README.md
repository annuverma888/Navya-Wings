# Inspiration
In recent times, the alarming increase in the rate of student suicides has become a deeply concerning reality. Being students ourselves, we noticed that many of our peers were silently struggling with stress and mental health challenges. We observed the tangible impact of academic pressure and limited access to mental health support, exacerbating the rise in student suicides. This hit close to home, and we felt a strong need to do something about it. PsycheSail was born from our own experiences and the burning desire to create a tool that helps students navigate the challenges of student life with better mental health. We are driven by the mission to ensure every student has the support they need to thrive, and that's why we created PsycheSail â€“ to be a friend in tough times.
